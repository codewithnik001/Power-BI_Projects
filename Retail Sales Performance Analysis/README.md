📊 Sales Data Analysis & Forecasting Dashboard
Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sales performance using Power BI. The goal was to transform raw sales records into an interactive dashboard that tracks Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Profit Margins, and Sales Growth.

By visualizing data across multiple dimensions (Region, Product, and Time), this dashboard empowers stakeholders to identify high-performing segments and uncover opportunities to optimize inventory and pricing strategies.

🎯 Key Business Problems Solved
Revenue & Profit Tracking: How are sales trending Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY)?

Regional Performance: Which regions are contributing the most to the bottom line, and which are underperforming?

Product Strategy: Which products are the "Cash Cows" (High Sales, High Profit) vs. "Loss Makers"?

Forecasting: What is the projected sales trend for the next quarter based on historical patterns?

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
Power BI Desktop: Used for data ingestion, modeling, and visualization.

Power Query (ETL):

Cleaned and transformed raw data (removed duplicates, handled null values, fixed data types).

Created conditional columns for custom categorization.

Data Modeling:

Designed a Star Schema with Fact tables (Sales) and Dimension tables (Products, Customers, Dates).

Established active relationships (One-to-Many) to ensure accurate filtering.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):

Created explicit measures for Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin %.

Used Time Intelligence functions like SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR and DATESYTD for growth analysis.

💡 Key Insights
Top Performer: The [Insert Top Region, e.g., West] region accounts for XX% of total revenue.

Profit Drivers: While [Product A] has the highest sales volume, [Product B] delivers the highest profit margin.

Seasonality: Sales consistently peak in [Insert Month, e.g., Q4/December], suggesting a need for inventory stocking in Q3.
